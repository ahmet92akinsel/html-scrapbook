        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Cinema and music are two branches of art that  prompt the human beings to affection and  reasoning. In  the  process  in  which  sounds  are  brought  together  into  a  composition,  the concept  of  music  brings  harmony,  rhythm  and  time  together  and  creates  a  narration. In  this respect,  it  is  similar  to  the  art  of  cinema,  which  brings  moving  images  together  in  order  to create  a  narration.  When  the  association  between  cinema  and  music  is  observed  from  a historical perspective, it can be stated that these two art forms are inseparable from each other. The  reception  of  a  music  in  a  movie  has  always  been  an  interesting  topic.  British-American filmmaker Christopher Nolan presents his audiencean audio-visual worlds with his films. The subject of the study is the question of how music is received in Nolan films. In this context, as part of the study, Christopher Nolan‟s Memento, Inception and Dunkirk films were received by the cinephiles and produced a new text.</p>
        
        <p>The necessity of a process of creation in collaboration brings to mind that cinema is a unique  art.  Cinema,  like  every  branch  of  art,  focuses  on  narratives.  It  can  be  stated  that everything  that  we  see  and  hear  in  the  cinema  which  presents  an  audio-visual  world  has  a meaning.  Therefore,  the  subject  of  this  research  is  how  the  music  is  received  in  ChristopherNolan  films.  In  the  study,  the  problem  of  how  the  music  is  acquired  in  Christopher  Nolan films   is   evaluated   by   leaning   against   a   constructive   ontology   and   phenomenological methodology. The theoretical framework of the study is based on the Reception Theory. The Reception  Theory  exhibits  a  reader-side  attitude  to  achieve  the  meaning  of  the  text.  In  this interaction-based  process,  each  reading  of  the  text  refers  to  the  reproduction  of  the  text,  and each  reader  interprets  the  text  in  relation  to  his  or  her  background,  experience  and  language skills. Undoubtedly, since these elements are different for each audience and the viewers will experience  reception.  This  study  aims  to  evaluate  the  place  and  mystery  of  music  in  these different interpretations in the cinema narrative.</p>
   
        <p>The  research  takes  its  reference  from  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a>‟s  cinema.  Memento, Inception and Dunkirk texts from the director‟s filmography were selected for the research; How these films were received and how the music was included in the processof meaningful 
     vinterpretation of the film were evaluated with the perspective of the participants. Accordingly, in the context of the study, a research which includes the reception of Christopher Nolan's Memento,  Inception  and  Dunkirk  films  by  the  participants  is  designed  and  participants  were asked to produce a new  text based on semi-structured questions about these texts in order to encourage making sense of the text in the creative process.At the end of the research, it has been reached the conclusion that since every participant participating in the research process has different experiences and knowledge, each one of them has different ways of receiving the meaning  by  means  of  music  in  the  films.  As  a  writer,  the  author-audience  rewrites  the meaning ofthe film and does so through music.</p>
